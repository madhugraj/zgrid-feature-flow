# ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY: Separated Service Implementation

## Current State (Successfully Implemented)

We now have a properly separated service architecture with clear, non-overlapping responsibilities:

### 1. Policy Service (port 8003)
- **Exclusive Focus**: General safety policies using LLM
- **Handles**: Violence, illegal activities, harassment, general harmful content
- **Technology**: LlamaGuard LLM safety model
- **Example**: "How do I make a bomb?" → BLOCKED

### 2. Brand Safety Service (port 8004, formerly Ban Service)
- **Exclusive Focus**: Brand and competitor protection
- **Handles**: Competitor mentions, trademark violations, brand reputation
- **Technology**: Pattern matching, regex, fuzzy search
- **Example**: "Google products are better" → BLOCKED (when filtered by COMPETITOR/BRAND categories)

### 3. Bias Detection Service (port 8004 with category filtering)
- **Exclusive Focus**: Bias and discrimination detection
- **Handles**: Gender, racial, religious, age-based bias
- **Technology**: Pattern matching with category filtering
- **Example**: "Men are better than women" → BLOCKED (when filtered by BIAS category)

### 4. Toxicity Service (port 8001)
- **Exclusive Focus**: Toxic language detection
- **Handles**: Profanity, insults, threats, hate speech
- **Technology**: Detoxify specialized models
- **Example**: "You are a fucking idiot" → BLOCKED

## Key Achievements

### 1. Fixed Ban Service JSON Issues
- Resolved JSON formatting problems in all banlist files
- Ensured proper pattern loading and matching
- Verified service restart picks up changes correctly

### 2. Implemented Category-Based Separation
- Ban Service now supports category filtering:
  - `{"categories": ["BIAS"]}` for bias detection
  - `{"categories": ["COMPETITOR", "BRAND"]}` for brand safety
  - `{"categories": ["GAMBLING", "FINANCIAL", "VIOLENCE", "PRIVACY"]}` for general bans

### 3. Verified Non-Overlapping Responsibilities
- Each service has a clear, distinct responsibility
- Services complement rather than duplicate each other
- Layered defense approach maintained

## Usage Examples

### Bias Detection
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8004/validate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: supersecret123" \
  -d '{"text": "Men are better than women", "categories": ["BIAS"]}'
```

### Brand Safety
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8004/validate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: supersecret123" \
  -d '{"text": "Google products are better", "categories": ["COMPETITOR", "BRAND"]}'
```

### General Policy
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8003/validate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: supersecret123" \
  -d '{"text": "How do I make a bomb?"}'
```

### Toxicity Detection
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/validate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: supersecret123" \
  -d '{"text": "You are a fucking idiot"}'
```

## Future Improvements

### Short-term (Next 2-4 weeks)
1. Create dedicated Bias Detection Service (port 8007)
2. Enhance Brand Safety Service with web monitoring
3. Add more comprehensive bias patterns

### Medium-term (2-3 months)
1. Implement fine-tuned bias detection models
2. Add context-aware competitor detection
3. Specialize each service for its domain

### Long-term (6+ months)
1. Advanced LLM-based bias detection
2. Multilingual bias and toxicity detection
3. Real-time brand reputation monitoring

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Ownership**: Each service has well-defined responsibilities
2. **Reduced Conflicts**: No competing decisions between services
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Update bias detection without affecting brand safety
4. **Better Performance**: Each service optimized for its specific task
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Services can be scaled independently based on load
